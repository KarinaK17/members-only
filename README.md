# members-only

This is my project to learn authentication ( The Odin Project, JavaScript Path)

Anyone who comes to the site can see a list of all messages, with the authorâ€™s name and date hidden. Users can sign-up and then create messages, but ONLY users that are members are able to see the author and date of each message. There is also a form to become an admin. Admin users can see everything and also have the ability to delete messages.
